        <title>Starting Fresh</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m starting fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have no idea what this means.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I do know a few things about whatâ€™s going on. Letâ€™s talk about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clients&quot;&gt;Clients&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few months have been a blur to me. Itâ€™s been a pretty insane grind, but itâ€™s all been worth it. Balancing this with other commitments becomes a burden, but itâ€™s something that I have a passion for and I really donâ€™t mind. Iâ€™ve been enjoying work more than ever, and itâ€™s great to be able to move some Trello cards after a boring day at school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;school&quot;&gt;School&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family moved. A new school. For anyone thatâ€™s pretty terrifying. It can also be very rewarding, and you can use it to your advantage. For example, new friends. Iâ€™ve fit myself into a totally different group of friends at my new high school. Not to discredit my old friends, but sometimes a change can be interesting. At the same time, it can also be little depressing. I miss many of the friends that I had at my old school. Even though I still live only a 45 minute drive away from my old house, I still find it frustrating that I canâ€™t spend more time with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving&quot;&gt;Moving&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving has been awesomeâ€”to say the least. Itâ€™s been quite a change, but honestly that change is for the better. Iâ€™ve moved into much closer proximity to downtown Denver which makes working downtown on the weekends a breeze. Where I used to live, it was difficult to get around without a car, just because of the fact that itâ€™s suburb. Here, I can bike or ride a bus almost everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s the recap, but I canâ€™t honestly tell you much about how things may or may not end up. All I can tell you is that itâ€™s going to be an interesting journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letâ€™s begin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
