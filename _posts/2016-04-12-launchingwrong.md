I said it, I don't launch right. Launching has never been my strong suit, and I'm reluctant to launch every time. I'm afraid of launching, it has always been the hardest thing for me.

"What if people don't like what I make?" "What if it sucks?" "Why would people want to use this?" All of these questions consistently run through my mind before throwing something out to the crowd.

After this, my perfectionism gets to me, and I can't launch it. I'm not confident in my **own** product to launch it. 

"I'd rather launch another person's product than my own," I think to myself. *Why isn't my product good enough?*

What does the word "enough" mean? According to the dictionary, it means the following:

>    as much or as many as required

**What does that even mean?!?**

*You* set the "much" and the "as many" for yourself, no one else can make that for you. That is a standard that *you* set for yourself. You can set the bar as high or as low as you want, but generally it's high. 

You feel the need to compete.

You want to win. What's the prize? Your own accomplishment. Why would you want to feel good about something when it's never going to be done? How long is the project going to take to perfection? Weeks? Months? Years?

Nothing is ever going to change if perfectionism holds an person back every time. No one is able to improve themselves if they always struggle to receive feedback.

Launches can go well or poorly, and it's not your fault if it goes poorly. Nothing is always going to work out, you just need to be able to realize your mistakes for the future. It stinks to make the same mistake multiple times.

**Feel confident in your work.**
