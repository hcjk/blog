Hey everyone! I got a very special and exciting announcement! I'm going to be starting a new development series!

So as many of you probably already know, I haven't been uploading many videos lately. This has been due to my busy schedule, but also just a laziness that has come over me recently. Anyways, I'm going to change that and start a new series focused on building a Reddit clone with React, Node, and MongoDB.

So many of you are probably thinking, *what the heck, didn't this guy already make a series on how to make a Reddit clone???*

That's correct. However, if you check out those videos, you'll realize the code is very basic and it doesn't have much functionality.

With this series, I'm going to change that. This series is going to be a complex tutorial and demo on how to build a Reddit clone with some of the best technologies available, React, Node, MongoDB.

So here's a little backstory to this idea: A few months ago, I bought the domain [literally.top](http://literally.top), without much of a purpose (only because it was on sale). Since then, I've been wanting to do something really cool with the domain, but I wasn't sure what I wanted to build. Then one day I realized it would be really neat to show how to build a Reddit clone on top of it. So here we are!

With this series, I'm going to try to be pushing out videos as fast as possible, while still maintaining a high level of quality. Currently, I'm not sure how fast this will be, possibly every day during the week.

Also, with this, I want to give you guys my course plan/attack for this course. These are the episodes that I'm planning on having in the series and I may add more if needed.

```
1. Laying out the project
2. Creating the Node base
3. User sign up and login (Node)
4. SubTop schema and creation (Node)
5. Subscribing (Node)
6. Creating posts (Node)
7. Commenting on posts (Node)
8. Upvoting posts (Node)
9. Creating the React base
10. Logging in and signing up (React)
11. Viewing SubTops & subscribing (React)
12. Creating posts (React)
13. Viewing posts (React)
14. Commenting on posts (React)
15. Upvoting posts (React)
16. Bug Fixes & Wrap Up
```

So that's that! I just wanted to give everyone a bit of a heads up on what's to come in the next few weeks/months. I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys think!

*Thanks for reading!*
