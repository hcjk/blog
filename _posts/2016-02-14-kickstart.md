2016 began, and many people had New Year’s resolutions. I heard a whole slew of different plans, unfortunately many will end up unaccomplished. At the beginning of this year, I thought to myself, what do I want to accomplish?

**I want to make sure I create more meaningful content.**

Making meaningful content has always been a goal of mine, and it should be a goal of everyone. People do not want to consume content that is meaningless, but rather something that has purpose.

I, myself in 2016, being a designer and developer want to create awesome material that everyone can reach a large audience.

## How can we do this?
In 2016, I am launching a new idea, A Thing A Week, a Slack group focused on creating a meaningful product every single week. Whether that product is a simple website to a full-blown web application to a mobile application. The focus is on creating and launching one awesome “thing” every single week.

Every week, A Thing A Week will have a theme to build upon. A new theme will be pushed out every Sunday night, and we will have a kickoff Blab to start off the new theme. People will have till the end of the week to work on their products, and on Friday, individuals can submit their products to [show.athingaweek.com](show.athingaweek.com), where they can show off the awesomeness that they built!

**I’m looking forward to seeing what you guys will make of this!**

_Let’s make 2016 the best year every and launch some awesome ideas! Join A Thing A Week [here](http://www.athingaweek.com)._
